#  Project Highlight 
In the realm of Applied Linguistics, text mining proved to be fruitful, especially in L2 Research. 
For example, this project aims to get the most frequent n-grams (i.e., unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams) of different research paradigms, including both quantitative and qualitative papers.
The primary objective is to identify language usage patterns within these paradigms by determining the word/words occurring most frequently in the corpus of quantitative and qualitative papers.
Furthermore, I conducted linguistic analyses using spaCy, including part-of-speech tagging, morphological analysis, and syntactic dependency parsing, to provide deeper insights into the textual characteristics of these research papers.

## Data Confidentiality 
The dataset is confidential as it is owned by my dear Linguistics Professor. Consequently, given the ethical considerations of data sharing, I am unable to share the specific data used in this analysis.
## Brown Corpus as a Substitute 
Hence, to ensure transparency in data analysis, I have used the Brown corpus, an open-access dataset comprising a versatile array of text from different resources. This corpus can serve as a substitute to showcase the keyword analysis. 
Feel free to download the "BROWN.txt" file from this repository.
In addition, you can use your own text file for extracting linguistic data.
